## 🧩 About Me

I am a mathematics graduate passionate about **computational mathematics**, **machine learning**, and **data-driven modeling**.  
Alongside my academic background, I have taught **Mathematics and Physics to 9th and 10th grade students**, and have also worked as a **part-time WordPress website developer**. These experiences have helped me develop strong communication, analytical, and technical skills.

My undergraduate research project focused on **Geometric Function Theory**, where I explored analytic and univalent functions and their geometric properties. This work deepened my appreciation for the link between pure mathematics and computational techniques.

I am currently preparing my application for the **Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS)**, focusing on research that bridges **mathematics, computation, and artificial intelligence**.
